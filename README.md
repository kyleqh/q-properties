This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the json server:

```bash
npm run json-server
# or (items below are not tested)
yarn json-server
# or
pnpm json-server
# or
bun json-server
```

Then, run the development server (you will need a new terminal for this):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Run the application by clicking on "Property Listings" at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/property) in your browser.

Challenges:
- time constraint made it challenging to test-drive the application
- CSS is not 100% and this was a little challenging, given the timeframe
